# Business analysis

## Primary objectives

- To provide an easy-to-use service for private customers to capture their shopping receipts and analyse their purchasing habits
- To provide API integration methods for 3rd party software for historical and live analysis to our corporate customers

## Scope

Initial scope during the iti0203-2020 team project

- Part 1: Creating a webapp and backend service to facilitate proof of concept functionality 
- Part 2: Step up a deployment pipeline and live environment
- Part 3: Add auth layer and basic OCR functionality for receipt photos

## Further scope

- Store images externally on AWS S3
- Add separate paid account tiers and restrictive usage limitations to manage our costs
- Learn and implement text categorization to match item names, prices and metadata on the receipt to correct fields
- Expose OCR functionality as a separate feature for corporate customers

## Plan

- Review our resources (time and people) after the initial project phase and come up with a specific timeline for our roadmap
- Finish incomplete user stories currently defined before creating new to cover the future scope
- Find a dedicated project manager / business type person to plan out the legal/financial side
- Find more developers if required

## Monetization

- Paid customer tiers for features: uploaded image size, uploads per month, analysis time per month
- Paid corporate tiers with pay-per-usage and support
- Leasing our integrations to other service providers
